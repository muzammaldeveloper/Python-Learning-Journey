    "#  Frequency Counter in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This script counts the frequency of each number in a list using a dictionary. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List Creation:**  \n",
    "   A list named `my_list` is created, which contains several numbers â€” some of them appear more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Empty Dictionary Initialization:**  \n",
    "   An empty dictionary called `frequency` is initialized. This will be used to store each unique number along with the number of times it appears in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Frequency Calculation using a `for` loop:**  \n",
    "   The script iterates over each element in the list:\n",
    "   - If the number is already present in the dictionary, its value (count) is incremented by 1.\n",
    "   - If the number is not in the dictionary, it is added with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display Output:**  \n",
    "   Finally, the script prints the dictionary, which shows each number and how many times it occurred in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Example Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 5, 5: 6}\n",
    "\n"
